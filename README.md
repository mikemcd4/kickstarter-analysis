# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to help Louise with her fundraising campaign for her new play, *Fever*. It nearly raised its' fundraising goal in a short amount of time, however with the data complied from this project, we are able to see how other projects fared; based on their fundraising goals, the country of origin, and category of project. The purpose of analyzing this data is to determine what criteria Louise's campaign needs to abide by in order to have the best chance at being successful.

## Analysis and Challenges

After careful analysis, we can see that the parent category **Plays**, which includes theater productions, overall has more successful campaigns than failed campaigns, as seen below.

This is **great** news for Louise! Further analysis shows us that most successful kickstarters occur towards the beginning of the year, as seen below.

However, in order to help Louise as best as I could, I knew I would have to dive deeper into the data, specifically into the **Theaters** subcategory. With the use of filtering, as well as the visualization tools Excel provides, I was able to make the data more relevant to our specific situation.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

 The first graph below shows the results of the number of successful, failed, or canceled theater projects by the month it was launched, which tells us that it is best to launch a campaign earlier in the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The next graph below shows the results of outcomes for Theater performances in relationship to their initial fundraising goals. As we can see, for the most part, having a lower fundraising goal correlates to a higher rate of successful campaigns. However, other factors, such as outliers, have slightly skewed the data, specifically in some of the extreme higher ranges of campaign goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Some challenges I faced during this analysis were figuring out how to correctly filter certain pieces of data to tell a more clear picture, as well as becoming comfortable with the format of the different functions and formulas used.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Overall, it appears that to have the highest chance of running a successful campaign, it is best to launch the campaign earlier in the year. Vice versa, launching a campaign towards the end of the year increases the chance of the campaign failing.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
This graph doesn't paint as clear a picture as the previous graph, however it seems fair to say that for the most part, a lower fundraising goal correlates to a higher chance of the campaign being successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One immediate limitation I notice is the lack of representation of any possible outliers. One way to correct this, which was demonstrated in a practice module, would be to include a box and whisker plot to better visualize any outliers. Another limitation could be having to manually input any new campaigns that begin now or in the future, instead of being able to automate that process.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create a graph representing the outcomes of the campaigns based on how long the fundraising campaigns lasted for, as well as break down our current data to filter for relevant countries that the kickstarter would take place, such as just the U.S. or U.K.
